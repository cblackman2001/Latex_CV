\headright{Placement Experience}

\textbf{Children's Ward at} \textbf{\textit{St Helier Hospital}}  \\
\dates{May - July 2025} \\
\smaller{For my management placement on a general paediatric ward I demonstrated the skills to provide nursing care to a range of my own caseloads of patients under nurse supervision. I implemented leadership skills into my practice by leading and partaking in staff handovers and discussions within the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) using clear communication. From this I recognised the importance of teamwork and co-operative care planning with the MDT and patients. I received positive feedback on my work with mental health patients from the Mental Health CNS.}

\textbf{Children's Day Surgery Unit at}  \textbf{\textit{St Helier Hospital}} \\
\dates{September – November 2024} \\
\smaller{On the surgical unit I was responsible for preparing patients for theatre and caring for them afterwards. I practiced pre and post-operative care including admission, receiving patients in recovery and monitoring vital signs and pain on return to the ward. I engaged in difficult conversations with families and managed a number of patients independently under nurse supervision.}

\textbf{Accident \& Emergency (A\&E) at} \textbf{\textit{St Helier Hospital}}  \\
\dates{July – August 2024} \\
\smaller{I was able to gain adult nursing experience where I learnt how to manage busier environments and large caseloads of patients. I advocated for patients who were unable to for themselves and negotiated care with them and members of the multi-disciplinary team.}

\textbf{Children's Outpatients Department at} \textbf{\textit{Kingston Hospital}}  \\
\dates{May – June 2024} \\
\smaller{In this department I strengthened communication skills by gaining responsibility of multiple clinics within the unit. I chaperoned clinics and gained a further understanding of nursing roles and responsibilities by observing nurse led clinics.}

\textbf{Casey Ward at} \textbf{\textit{Epsom Hospital}}  \\
\dates{February – April 2024} \\
\smaller{On this general paediatric ward, I provided nursing care to a range of patients. I continued building knowledge on common paediatric conditions, primarily mental health admissions. I cared for and worked with complex care patients with brain injuries, assisting in moving and handling, and personal care - ensuring to maintain dignity. I further practiced medicine management skills and completed nursing documentation.}

\textbf{Children's Community Nursing at} \textbf{\textit{St Helier Hospital}}  \\
\dates{November – December 2023} \\
\smaller{Here I visited patient homes and schools within the community nursing team to provide nursing care.
